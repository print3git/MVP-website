Here are the remaining things to add before we pitch to investors:

1. Add in a 3d model 'displayer' and connect this to the main page, community creations page, and payment page.
2. Create Stripe account, get API keys, integrate Stripe into frontend, configure the existing Stripe
backend file
3. Either by directly downloading Hunyuan3D 2.0, or by using an existing plugin for it, integrate this as
the model generator. Ensure it works for both text, images, and text+images prompts.
4. Configure the 'recent' and 'popular' pages on the Community Creations page


(optional)
- add in a 'print3 discount' for customers who purchase 3 prints.
