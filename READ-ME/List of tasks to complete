Here are the remaining things to do before we pitch to investors:

Note: the lightweight Hunyuan3D API server files have been moved from the
`img/` directory to `backend/hunyuan_server/` so that `img/` only contains
image assets.

- Either by directly downloading Hunyuan 2.5, or by using an existing plugin for it, integrate this as
the model generator. Ensure it works for both text, images, and text+images prompts.

(optional for now, but certainly do these long-term)
- Configure the 'recent' and 'popular' pages on the Community Creations page
