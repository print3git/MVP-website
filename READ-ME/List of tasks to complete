Here are the remaining things to do before we pitch to investors:

Note: the lightweight Hunyuan3D API server files have been moved from the
`img/` directory to `backend/hunyuan_server/` so that `img/` only contains
image assets.

- Either by directly downloading Hunyuan3D 2.0, or by using an existing plugin for it, integrate this as
the model generator. Ensure it works for both text, images, and text+images prompts.
- Create Stripe account, get API keys, integrate Stripe into frontend, configure the existing Stripe
backend file
------ When you later create (and verify) your real Stripe account you will simply:
    1. Replace the placeholder keys with your own dashboard keys.
    2. Switch the “mode” flag from test to live (or just deploy the same code with live keys)."
- Create the database (SQL?)
- add 'share' options to twitter, facebook, tiktok, instagram




(optional for now, but certainly do these long-term)
- Configure the 'recent' and 'popular' pages on the Community Creations page
- add in a 'print3 discount' for customers who purchase 3 prints.
- add in an 'opt-out' button at the purchase page for adding the design to the 'Community Creations' page:
we want this to be opt-out to encourage as much sharing as possible, to build up the catalogue and 
encourage the community
