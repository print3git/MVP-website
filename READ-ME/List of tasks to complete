Here are the remaining things to do before we pitch to investors:

Note: the lightweight Hunyuan3D API server files have been moved from the
`img/` directory to `backend/hunyuan_server/` so that `img/` only contains
image assets.

- Either by directly downloading Hunyuan 2.5, or by using an existing plugin for it, integrate this as
the model generator. Ensure it works for both text, images, and text+images prompts.
- add 'share' options to twitter, facebook, tiktok, instagram

(optional for now, but certainly do these long-term)
- Configure the 'recent' and 'popular' pages on the Community Creations page
- add in a 'print2 discount' for customers who purchase 3 prints.
- add in an 'opt-out' button at the purchase page for adding the design to the 'Community Creations' page:
we want this to be opt-out to encourage as much sharing as possible, to build up the catalogue and 
encourage the community
