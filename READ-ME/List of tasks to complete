## High-Level Tasks (from README.md)

- Integrate Hunyuan 2.5 as the model generator for text, image, and text+image prompts.
- Configure the "recent" and "popular" pages on the Community Creations page.
- Remove temporary OBJ files after conversion in the Hunyuan3D server.
- Add Jest tests for error cases in the Hunyuan3D server.
- Add pagination to the `/api/status` endpoint.
- Replace the simple print queue with a real queue module.
- Improve UI error handling and ensure accessibility with ARIA labels and contrast.
- Fetch and display recent and popular creations with pagination or infinite scrolling.
- Add filters by category or date and store submissions in a `community_creations` table.
- Add GitHub Actions workflows to run `npm test` and Prettier checks.
- Add unit tests for frontend scripts and mock the Hunyuan API for server error tests.
- Move notes from `READ-ME/` to a `docs/` folder and include architecture diagrams.
- Normalize file names, delete placeholders, review console logs, and check for unused dependencies.
- Implement a profiles system with user accounts, likes, and competitions:
  - Add a `users` table with registration and login endpoints.
  - Add authentication middleware and sign-up/sign-in forms.
  - Link generated models to the authenticated user.
  - Provide APIs and profile pages to show a user's models and like counts.
  - Allow liking/unliking models and use like counts to populate "popular now" lists.
  - Add competitions tables and endpoints to submit and show leaderboards.

Here are the remaining things to do before we pitch to investors:

Note: the lightweight Hunyuan3D API server files have been moved from the
`img/` directory to `backend/hunyuan_server/` so that `img/` only contains
image assets.

- Either by directly downloading Hunyuan 2.5, or by using an existing plugin for it, integrate this as
the model generator. Ensure it works for both text, images, and text+images prompts.

(optional for now, but certainly do these long-term)
- Configure the 'recent' and 'popular' pages on the Community Creations page
