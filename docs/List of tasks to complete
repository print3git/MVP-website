## High-Level Tasks (from README.md)

- Integrate Hunyuan 2.5 as the model generator for text, image, and text+image prompts.
- Configure the "recent" and "popular" pages on the Community Creations page.
- Replace the simple print queue with a real queue module.
- Improve UI error handling and ensure accessibility with ARIA labels and contrast.
- Fetch and display recent and popular creations with pagination or infinite scrolling.
- Add filters by category or date and store submissions in a `community_creations` table.
- Add unit tests for frontend scripts and mock the Hunyuan API for server error tests.
- Include architecture diagrams in the `docs/` folder.
- Review all console logs and check for unused dependencies.
- Implement a profiles system with user accounts, likes, and competitions:
  - Use like counts to populate "popular now" lists.
  - Add competitions tables and endpoints to submit and show leaderboards.

Here are the remaining things to do before we pitch to investors:

Note: the lightweight Hunyuan3D API server files have been moved from the
`img/` directory to `backend/hunyuan_server/` so that `img/` only contains
image assets.

- Either by directly downloading Hunyuan 2.5, or by using an existing plugin for it, integrate this as
  the model generator. Ensure it works for both text, images, and text+images prompts.

(optional for now, but certainly do these long-term)

- Configure the 'recent' and 'popular' pages on the Community Creations page

## UX Improvements for a frictionless "prompt → model → buy"
- Guide the user with a step-by-step wizard from entering a prompt through to checkout.
- Provide pre-made example prompts and images to help new visitors start quickly.
- Add drag-and-drop image uploads with inline cropping and resizing.
- Show a real-time progress bar while the model is being generated.
- Display clear inline error messages if generation fails or the prompt is invalid.
- Keep the generated model and prompt in local storage so users can resume where they left off.
- Integrate social login (Google, GitHub) and allow guest checkout without creating an account.
- Automatically prefill shipping and payment details from the user's profile.
- Offer a one-click "Buy Now" button directly on the model viewer page.
- Let users edit the prompt or images without losing the current model.
- Ensure all interactions work smoothly on mobile with responsive layouts.
- Make keyboard navigation and screen reader labels first-class.
- Provide a "reorder" button for past models so users can purchase again instantly.
- Show estimated print cost and delivery time before checkout.
- Let users share a generated model to the community or social media with one click.
- Provide tooltips or a short tutorial overlay explaining each step.
- Add a progress indicator at the top summarizing "Prompt → Model → Buy."
- Optimize API requests to reduce loading time on slow networks.
- Save user preferences such as units or color scheme.
- Provide instant confirmation with next steps after the payment completes.
- Link directly from the success page to the user's profile or order history.
