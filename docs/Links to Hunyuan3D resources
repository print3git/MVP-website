This is the 'Hunyuan3D' AI model, an open-source model we will us to generate our images. It seems to be
the cutting-edge of this technology (at least, as far as open-source models are concerned). The most
recent update 'Hunyuan 2.5' was released in April 2025, so we need to move quickly to make use of it
before other companies catch on.
