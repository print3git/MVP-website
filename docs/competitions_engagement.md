# Competitions Engagement Ideas

A few ways the competitions page could help keep visitors returning:

- **Countdown timers** for entry deadlines so users know exactly when to submit.
- **Highlight previous winners** with images or short interviews.
- **Social sharing buttons** to encourage participants to share their entries.
- **Email notifications** when new contests launch or when voting begins.
- **Community voting** so visitors can like or rank submissions.
- **Featured themes** that change regularly to keep the challenges fresh.
- **Promotional prizes** such as free prints or merchandise for top entries.
- **Leaderboard updates** in real time to encourage competition.
- **Entry gallery** showcasing all submissions for inspiration.
